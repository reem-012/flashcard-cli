  - Card interface with spaced repetition fields
  - Deck interface for JSON structure
  - Difficulty type for user responses
  - StudySession interface for tracking progress
  - AppState interface for application state management

### Business Logic Layer - Completed (TDD)
- Implemented with full test coverage:
  - repetition.ts - Spaced repetition algorithm
    - calculateNextInterval function
    - getCardsDueForReview function with proper prioritization
  - scheduler.ts - Card scheduling logic
    - scheduleCard function
    - updateCardAfterReview function  
  - deckManager.ts - File I/O operations
    - loadDeck/saveDeck functions
    - createNewDeck function
    - addCardToDeck function
    - updateCardInDeck function
    - deleteCardFromDeck function
- All tests passing (27 tests total)

### UI Components - Completed

  - CardForm.tsx - Add/edit card form with text input
  - EditCardList.tsx - Card list manager with edit/delete functionality
  - App.tsx - Root component with state management and auto-save

### CLI Entry Point - Completed
- Created index.ts with:
  - Command line argument parsing
  - Path resolution
  - JSON file validation
  - App initialization

### Integration & Testing - Completed
- All business logic tests pass (27 tests)

- Created example deck file for testing
- Project ready for use with tsx/direct execution

### Known Issues
- TypeScript build has module resolution conflicts with Ink v6 
- Application runs correctly with tsx but build output may have issues
- For development: use `npm run dev` or `npx tsx src/index.ts example-deck.json`

## Project Complete! ðŸŽ‰

The flashcard CLI application has been successfully implemented with all planned features:

âœ… **Complete TUI Application** - Built with Ink and React
âœ… **Full Test Coverage** - 27 passing tests with TDD approach  
âœ… **Spaced Repetition Algorithm** - SM-2 variant implementation
âœ… **Comprehensive Documentation** - README, architecture docs, and examples
âœ… **Git Version Control** - Proper commit history and tracking

### Usage Instructions
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run with example: `npx tsx src/index.ts example-deck.json`
3. Use arrow keys to navigate, SPACE to reveal answers, numbers 1-3 to rate difficulty
4. Auto-saves after each interaction

The application is ready for use and further development!
